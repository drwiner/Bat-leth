Bipartite Partial-Order Causal-Link (BiPOCL) Planner: a plan-space search where each child node is a refinement to some flaw of the parent node. The algorithm iteratively selects plan at frontier of
search, selects a flaw, refines flaws, identifies new flaws, and repeats.

Implemented with Python 3.
